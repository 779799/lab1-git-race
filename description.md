## How to test the code
Testing is handled using JUnit, a powerful framework that allows you to check different aspects of your code.

Unit tests can be run with the following commands.
```
$ cd lab1-git-race
$ gradle test
```

All verification tasks, including unit tests, can be run with the following commands. Gradle offers a flag, -i, that can be used to show more information while running the checks.
```
$ cd lab1-git-race
$ gradle check
```
